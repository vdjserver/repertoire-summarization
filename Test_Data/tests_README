README for tests.

###############################################

4 test files:

1)human.IG.fna
2)human.TR.fna
3)Mus_musculus.IG.fna
4)Mus_musculus.TR.fna

of data are available for testing purposes.  The tests.sh script calls rep_char and IgBLAST
to IgBLAST the data and then run rep_char on the IgBLAST results.

##############################################

To run tests:

1)  open tests.sh and make sure that the variables IGDATA and VDJ_DB_ROOT point to valid IGDATA and VDJ_DB_ROOT directories.  
    (IGDATA points to the base of an IGBLAST installation, VDJ_DB_ROOT points to the base of a VDJ_database directory ; see the other readme's for more information)
2)  similarly make sure that NEW_PYTHONPATH points to where vdjml_igblast_parse.py can be found (in the vdjml package)
3)  make sure that the AUX_PATH variables for each organism resolve to existing .aux files under the IGDATA directory
4)  issue the command "../rep_char.py -h" to get the help message for rep_char.  If you can get the help message that should be a good sign that the python files are set up correcly and that the modules can be loaded.  If you get an error, it is likely about a missing module.  Install the module to fix the error, then re-issue "../rep_char.py -h" until the error is resolved.

Once the above 4 are done without error, you should be able to issue "./tests.sh" to run through the tests.
Optionally, you should be able to issue "./tests.sh 10" to run tests on simulated data siuated by "vdj_sim.py" (in addition to the regular tests) (10 indicates 10 simulated sequences per simulated run).

Once the tests.sh script is run, issue "ls -alh *.err" to see the stderr dumped output files.  If all the files are empty, then there is success.
Otherwise, view the contents of the files for technical error information.
