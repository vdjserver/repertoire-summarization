README for tests.

To run tests:

1)  open tests.sh and make sure that the variables IGDATA and VDJ_DB_ROOT point to valid directories
2)  make sure that the AUX_PATH variables for each organism resolve to existing .aux files under the IGDATA directory
3)  issue the command "../rep_char.py -h" to get the help message for rep_char.  If you can get the help message that should be a good sign that the python files are set up correcly and that the modules can be loaded

Once the above 3 are done without error, you should be able to issue "./tests.sh" to run through the tests.
